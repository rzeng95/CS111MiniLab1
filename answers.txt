Response to Exercise 1:
No. run(current) takes into account the earlier line of code where reg_eax gets assigned the value of current's p_pid. schedule() does not do this. See line 145 of mpos_kern.c where 
"we use %eax for system call return values"
Hence, because eax register not updated in schedule(), we will not get the correct return result.



Anything else you'd like us to know:
There's a bunch of commented out code in mpos_kern.c
Originally I was working with a helper function exit_process that Tuan helped us implement.
However, it did not work, so I reverted to older code in EXIT_PROCESS.
